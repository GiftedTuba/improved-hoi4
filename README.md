# IMPROVED HEARTS OF IRON
Welcome to Improved Hearts of Iron, a mod that tries to improve hoi4 gameplay. The reason this mod was created is because, after a while, normal hoi4 can be boring. Users who get bored of hoi4 often turn to mods, like Road to 56, Milenium Dawn or the Great War, but some of those can be boring and can take away the fun out of hoi4. So this mod aims to not modify timelines or anything like that, instead, just adding focuses for nations, adding better gameplay, and improving the overall experience.

## Current Features:
Each Nation now has names in it's native tongue.
The Soviet Union is split up into it's several, seperatley playable soviet socialist republics. For example, you can now play the Russian SSR and Ukranian SSR seperatley.
And more!

## Future Features:
Focus Trees for several nations, as well as focus tree reworks for existing ones. Priority focus trees are for all the SSR's, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, Sweden and Norway
and additional gameplay fixes.

## Installing:
To install the mod, you need to clone the repository in your hoi4 mod directory. After that, you need to create a mod file called "improved-hoi4.mod" in the mod directory as well, but NOT in the directory as the individual mod files. Lastly, you need to open up your hearts of iron launcher, go to playsets, click "Add more mods", click the "Improved-Hoi4" mod, and make sure the selector is on green, Then, you can play!
